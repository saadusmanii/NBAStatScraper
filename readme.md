**NBA Stat Scrapper**
I created a NBA web scrapper using python and using pandas to display the Data extracted from the official NBA website. 

The Data I have extracted covers the playoffs and regular season from the 2012-13 to 2022-23 seasons, displaying the time it took to scrape the previous set of data for the regular and playoff seasons. The Data once scrapped is then placed into an accompanying excel file which displays and holds the stats for all players who the NBA has covered.
